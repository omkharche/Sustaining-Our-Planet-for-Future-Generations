										<h1>Importance of Environment</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/li2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>1. Eradication of poverty across the world</h3><p>These organizations primarily focus on the least developed and low-income countries where poverty is rife.

They aim to eradicate poverty across the board by expanding social protection programs like school feeding, cash transfers, targeted food assistance, social insurance and labor market programs such as skill training, old-age pensions, wage subsidies, unemployment insurance, disability pensions and so on.</p>
									
									<h3>2. Promotion of good health and well being</h3>
									<p>This sustainable development goal seeks to ensure good health and well-being for all at each stage of life. The goal takes into account all the main health priorities such as maternal and child health, reproductive health, environmental, communicable and non-communicable diseases, universal health coverage, and access to quality, safe, effective, and affordable vaccines and medicines.

It also advocates for enhanced health financing, increased research and development, strengthening the capacity of every country engaged in health risk prevention and management.</p><br>
									<h3>3. Provision of Quality Education For All</h3>
									<p>These bodies have realized that the level of child school dropout is at an all-time high. This gap must be closed to ensure sustainable future development even as international communities work to ensure quality and equity in the education sector.

In a nutshell, this goal seeks to ensure equitable and inclusive quality education and promotion of long-life learning opportunities.</p><br>
									<h3>4. Provision of Clean Water and Sanitation</h3>
									<p>Water and sanitation are on top of the chart regarding sustainable development. They are critical to the survival of humans and the planet. This goal aims to address aspects relating to sanitation, hygiene, drinking water and the quality and sustainability of water resources across the globe.</p><br>
									<h3>5. Building up Strong Infrastructure, Supporting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Incubating Innovation</h3>
									<p>This goal takes into account three aspects of sustainable development: industrialization, infrastructure, and innovation. Infrastructure is vital because it offers the basic framework necessary to smooth the running of enterprise and society at large.


Industrialization drives up economic development, yield job opportunities, hence, reducing levels of poverty. Innovation enhances the technological abilities of industrial sectors and triggers the development of innovative skills.</p><br>
									<h3>6. Enabling Access to Affordable and Clean Energy
</h3>
									<p>Energy is the most critical resource to achieving most of the sustainable development goals. Energy plays a vital role in mitigating poverty through advancements in industrialization, education, water supply and health and fighting climate change.

This sustainable development goal focuses on developing and expanding renewable energy resources such as sun, wind, hydropower, liquid and solid biofuels, biogas and geothermal.

These renewable sources of energy donâ€™t emit greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere and therefore are ideal for the environment and human health.</p><br>
										<h3>7. Achieving Gender Equality</h3>
									<p>In the past few decades, gender equality and women empowerment have been agendas for most governments for long-term sustainable development.


Access to education for girls has since improved, the percentage of child marriage has plummeted, and huge leaps have been taken in the domain of sexual and reproductive health and rights such as the dramatic reduction in maternal health.

Although there is still a long way to go to reach this milestone, organizations are using every ounce of their energy and throwing in resources to ensure the dream is realized.</p><br>
