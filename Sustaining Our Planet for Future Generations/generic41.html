										<h1>Future in 100 or 200 years</h1>

									<h3>Politics:</h3>
												<p>The US is still thumping stumps and claiming it is the greatest nation. China and India no longer seem to care or listen, being rich enough to be part of the new hegemon. Most countries have modernized and "3rd world" countries (in the sense of poor countries) have modernized. Network access is free for all, and considered a base right of all people.

Smaller countries have combined into unions to promote more trade. These unions are more like the EU than the US model. The EU itself has become fully federalized, with the capital in Brussels.

The UK is still independent from the EU, but has closer ties to the US. It's become a republic after abolishing royalty and peerage.

The US has peacefully consumed Canada, after Quebec Independence (our third try at annexing Canada. This time it's their idea). There is a motion to annex Mexico, but that will happen later (not in the next 100 years).

Populations of China,India and other Asian countries have stabilized to a slow growth rate. Africa is still a mess. Too many people, and too much fighting. The population of the world is at 15 billion, and growth has slowed, though not stopped.

The middle east - Numerous attempts at founding an islamic caliphate have failed, but still there has been a consolidation of countries, and the movement is still alive.</p>
											<br>
												<h3>Computing:</h3>
												<p>Massive parallel processors on a scale that can't be believed. Everything is networked, even throw-away items. Even people - our bodies are biological networked computers, and we use the new technologies to attach ourselves to the network. This leads to breakthroughs in communication, VR, medicine, etc. Wireless human networking becomes eerily like magic (telepathy, healing, etc).

</p><br>
												<h3>Transportation:</h3>
												<p>Automobiles are being replaced (slowly) by mass transit. But fleets of electric drone pods are getting more popular as well. Just call one, and it will arrive, step in and tell it where you are going, and it will fly you there and land you safely and quickly.</p><br>
												<h3>Power:</h3>
												<p>Tidal stations are supplying most of the power for seaboard cities. On the interior of the continents, there are still some nuclear plants. But most have been replaced by new types of power plants that simply harness the heat from the planet itself -- drill down deep enough (like 50,000 feet) and it gets really, really hot. However, a lot of power from steam can be generated quickly.</p><br>
												<h3>Space:</h3>
												<p>We'll have colonies on Mars and the Moon. However, not a lot of people live there, and not a lot of people even want to go. They'll grow slowly over the next 500 years, until a native born population has increased to critical mass. The Martian colony will be more successful, because of the water and air that already exists. However, people will live in fully enclosed cities, and have to extract heat from the planet itself. Space travel will still be costly, but with privatization, the cost has come down drastically. Intersystem travel is faster, and years of travel has become months. This is still very expensive, so sending someone or something to Mars is not common. Communication satellites are placed in orbit around the sun so that colonies on Mars and the Jovian moons are able to keep in touch with each other and with Earth.</p><br>
												<h3>Language:</h3>
												<p>People will keep their national languages alive, but minor regional languages will die out. Most business and scientific communication will be done using English and Chinese.</p><br>
												<h3>Global Warming/Climate Change:</h3>
												<p>Global warming will slow, but will still be a problem. The sea levels will slowly rise, but not enough (and not fast enough) to cause any issues that can't be addressed. Places that used to get snow once or twice a year will no longer get it. However, it's undeniable at this point in time, so there are active measures to combat it.</p><br>
												<h3>Education:</h3>
												<p>Education itself will be ran by teachers in conjunction with AI. This will allow students to learn at their own pace. The smart kids will no longer become bored under-achievers, and those that are disadvantaged can be taught at the rate that is most helpful for them. Standardized testing (the bane of the current system) will become more fair, and people will graduate based on knowledge, not on how long they've been in the system. Instead of being told to memorize passages in a book, the students will hold conversations in VR with an active AI that can answer questions and guide them, and ensure that they know the subject before moving on.</p><br>
												<h3>Robotics:</h3>
												<p>Robotics has advanced enough that multipurpose household robots are possible, though the vast majority of people do not care or want one. Still, some smaller robots are made that most people have - small machines that sweep, mop their floors, clean up after the dog, and pick up dirty clothes and things from the floor.</p><br>
												<h3>Employment:</h3>
												<p>Most work still requires a human. However, many more automated systems have been introduced, and a single person can do the work of many. This has led to a movement that it is OK to be unemployed, especially in a household that also already has an income. More people are moving to a contractor style arrangement, where they work when required or needed, pulling small jobs from job boards, etc. Others are moving more toward part time self employment on the web - creating entertainment, articles, impromptu acting (etc).</p><br>
												<h3>Relationships:</h3>
												<p>Despite dire predictions, the legalization of gay marriage didn't cause a collapse of society. In fact, it hardly made any difference at all. In general, less people overall are getting married, and more people are just choosing to live together without contracts. Marriage in general is still widely practiced, but just not what is expected. The next marriage war was over polygamy/polyandry, and while it never actually was legalized, it was decriminalized. This made very little impact, as it was not widely practiced besides a vocal few. At this point, people just basically quit caring.</p><br>
												<h3>Communication:</h3>
												<p>Networked people and constant access by anyone to the network has made cell phones a thing of the past. Now, you can communicate with basically anyone you want at any time. This became an incredible annoyance to people, and the rise of AI assistants to handle communication requests and take messages has become the norm.

Well, that's quite a bit for now. This is just off the top of my head.</p><br>
