									<p>No Sirsti. There is nothing humans can do that will markedly affect the type of climate changes that are likely to come. Indeed, if you want a snapshot of how charlatans have made ridiculous predictions for more than 30 years in recent times</p>
									<p>by Tony Heller; someone for whom I have great respect in terms of his knowledge, competence and integrity. On June 23 1988, NASA's James Hansen testified before Congress and made very specific predictions about global warming. This video shows how he got them exactly backwards, and how scientists and journalists continue to spread baseless misinformation.

If you want to know how it could be that hundreds of scientists have been “bought”.</p>
									<p>by Dr Roy Spencer. In this video Dr Roy Spencer, a person who once worked for NASA, describes how scientists have prostituted their integrity in order to have a safe, secure job.

You may think that there are literally thousands of scientists that agree with Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) and only a few hundred that think there is no substance to this claim. Exactly the opposite is the case. The derivation of the absolute statement that 97% of climate scientists agree with AGW was based on a series of frauds.</P>
									<p>by Lord Christopher Monckton.

So incensed were US scientists by this huge, and what was to them a demeaning, lie they started a petition to which there have now been over 32,000 signatories; all highly qualified people in science with more than 9,000 of them possessing PhDs. It’s called the “Global Warming Petition”. It says:

"There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.”</p>
									<p>The last one was really interesting to me because it gives all sorts of very interesting data plus amazing photographs from exploratory “landers” on Venus.

I'm sure you will enjoy them and find them most interesting.

You have nothing to worry about in terms of global warming but we may have a problem with global cooling if it becomes as bad as some people have predicted. Let’s hope that, like the alarmists that have cried the world will end in a ball of flame, those suggesting the most dire of consequences resulting from global cooling are making similar exaggerated predictions.</P>
