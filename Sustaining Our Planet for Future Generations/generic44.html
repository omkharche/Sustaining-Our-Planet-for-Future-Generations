										<h1>Humans can the planet Earth sustain</h1>

									<p>To reach endless future:

5 million, on condition they all live a simple, natural, scientific and healthy life style.

The current carrying capacity definition is wrong —- it is not a real sustainable carrying capacity which allow the nature allowed natural life span of the earth natural supporting systems to sustain human to the next 1.2 billion years to give us the evolution level to be connected to endless future; but it is a dragged along capacity that keeps the maximum material exploitation of the earth without immediate system collapse that run the economy on the highest marginal level to consume the maximum material value to bring the earth geothermal and eco systems to the earliest ending, humans with it.

The difference between the current carrying capacity definition and the real sustainable carrying capacity is that:

The current carrying capacity just means the maximum marginal level of material exploitation of the earth without immediate drastic system collapse; the real sustainable carrying capacity is aimed at the optimal compromise between the human optimal system size for its thinking and biological information evolution efficiency and the natural supporting systems longest nature allowed life time span and the optimal conditions that give human the optimal material base for the highest possible evolution level to ensure our connectivity to endless future.</p>
									<p>All natural process have endings, only rational process can connect processes to lead to endless future, which is an open process --- that is meant by sustainability.

The open process that can lead to future only can be achieved by rational process by humane and scientific methods but can never be achieved by the natural process of spider eat spider, man kill man.

It is a natural law that a contradiction cannot be solved by the cause of this contradiction --- natural process is the cause of this problem therefore cannot be used as solution for this problem.

</p>
									<p>More explanation:

Even the ancient organic and minimal disturbance agriculture is unsustainable. You can see many ancient civilisations fail due to top soil erosion and exhaustion and other environmental deterioration.

And our goal is to give both nature and human the optimal conditions for harmonic relation that give the nature minimal disturbance while human maximum evolution time and optimal evolution conditions to achieve maximum level of evolution (to exist in a fundamentally different existence state) to ensure human can be connected to endless future. That needs the next 1.2 billion years to achieve.

Therefore, the carrying capacity is not how many people the earth can bear without system collapse but what is the maximum evolution level human can achieve with the limited material value base.

For that purpose, we cannot allow any kind of marginal conditions to last in our social and natural systems in range but design a relation with large margin enough to create a harmonic relation with nature and our social system, where human don’t have to concentrate on economic activities but can get food and materials in nature with ease while give nature large room to adjust and evolve itself --- the essence is: not stress nature and not stress ourselves, because that does not have any positive effect for our final goal --- endless future.</p>
									<p>We need optimal relations that result in optimal evolution efficiency to achieve maximum evolution level to ensure connectivity to endless future. This design principle direct our design for the proportional relations between human population and nature environment.

Geothermal system and ecosystem natural life span decide the evolutionism that decide our thinking and biological information evolution level, therefore it is the most important factor, second is the conditions of the natural environment that deicide the evolution conditions that also affect the evolution efficiency. We can see that in the period of the ice age finishing period : when humans following the retreating ice to us the newly freed land with ample water, in renewed mineral balanced top soil, sparsely distributed population, evolution get into over drive. What we do is to rationally manmade recreate the conditions in a lasting and stable mode that ensure the optimal evolution efficiency in the next 1.2 billion years.

For that purpose, we have to rationally control our population in humane and scientific way, and live in simple, natural, scientific and healthy life style that minimise material consumption and minimise the disturbance to natural system. Totally eliminate the synthetic chemical pollution and synthetic polymer pollution, minimise and naturalise agriculture, resort to hunter gatherer style of food production to minimise the impact to nature. Under rationally small population and advanced science and technology that can be easily done.

Too small a population will negatively affect evolution efficiency, but too large population do the same thing from the opposite side. Population below 1 or 2 thousand will form genetic bottle neck and thinking information bottle neck that restrict thinking and biological evolution efficiency, but population that cause pressure on environment and cause competition in the population for material value also negatively affect evolution efficiency. Therefore global population should be kept between 10,000 to 5,000,000. Now it is best of the times for life on the earth for that conditions, we can keep the upper limit of population of the 5 million, but when the global environment conditions deteriorate after 1 billion years, we will have to reduce it to 10,000 to survive --- in good conditions, we concentrate on evolving, in bad times we concentrate on surviving.

Our future depend on our thinking and biological information evolution level but not on how much material power in our hand or how big is our population, these are the factors for our present power competition in natural process but that is exactly the way natural process locking all human on the track to extinction in manmade social system. We need to evolve into a fundamentally different existence state to be connected to higher process to reach endless future --- our endless future depends on our evolution level, and our evolution level depend on the material value base for that process --- we need both the longest evolution time and the optimal evolution conditions.

Space technology is useless for that purpose, computer neither helps much, therefore should not waste too much resources and pollute environment for them.

The population size is designed for this purpose --- to achieve human eternal existence.

Let population flout on top of the maximum material value availability is the natural process that will disconnect human from our endless future. Only rational process can lead us to endless future.</p>

Why natural process carried natural order cannot give human future?” “What are some interesting mathematic applications in natural science and social science?” “Are there natural laws that govern social science?” ”Tomorrow will be better? Will there be a "better tomorrow"?” “What do we fundamentally depend on to survive: adaptation or manipulation?” “What is the definition of "sustainability"?” “What are predictions on when the world will end based on?” “What is sustainable development?” “Why “pollute first, depollute later” is wrong?” “Can you compensate the resources consumption and environment destruction caused by economic activities with money?” “How come we do not control our own population as we do for all other species? Is this wise?”</p>
