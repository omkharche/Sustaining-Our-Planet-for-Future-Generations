										<h1>Earth ability to sustain human beings</h1>

									<p>The United States has improved its efficient use of energy at a rate of about 1% per year over the past century. During the Mideast Oil Crisis, we improved it at a rate of 4% per year. China is now aiming at a 4% per year improvement, and there are indications that they are succeeding.

The key fact is that if the world averages a 2% per year improvement, then in the year 2100, the entire world population can be living at the current European standard of living, and we will be using less energy than we are now.</p>
									<p>What about population growth? Every serious projection, including those of the United Nations, projects that world population will peak around 2050, at about 9 billion. That's higher than today's 7 billion, but sustainable.

What about resources other than energy? Human civilization has shown a great resilience, and ability to find substitutes. Moreover, we are getting very good at recycling. Nobody tears down a building without reusing the steel. In a famous bet with Paul Erlich, Julian Simon bet that over a ten year period the cost of natural resources would drop for a majority of materials, and he let Erlich pick the materials.</p>
									<p>Ten years later, Erlich paid off the bet. It turned out that the cost, in constant dollars, of every one of the natural resources Erlich had picked had done down. Simon offered to renew the bet, but Erlich refused, at least under the same conditions. He wanted to change the bet to be about how people felt about the world; did they think it was getting better.

I suspect that our general feeling that the world is getting worse is what drives us to make it better. So please don't read what I am writing and become complacent! But there is realism in optimism.</p>
									<p>Global warming? The key is energy conservation and reduced use of coal. Much of the CO2 remains in the atmosphere, so we will not easily undo the warming we have created so far (about 1.5 °C in the last 250 years), but we can limit it to another 1.5 °C by profitable means (conservation, efficiency, and new approaches to nuclear power) and I am convinced that it will be brought under control. We will adapt to the additional 1.5 °C rise.

Of course, we could have a thermonuclear war and wipe ourselves out. One can be pessimistic. But pessimism is not a consequence of the facts and our history and experience. There is good reason to think that civilization is nowhere near an end, and that things are getting better.

I am a student of history, and I like to ask the question: if you look back over known history, and pick a date when you could be reborn, what date would you pick. You must assume that you would be a random person, unlikely to be a king or super-wealthy person. What is the best year so far? I think the answer is obvious.</p>
